# hypercore-fetch

Implementation of Fetch that uses the Hyper SDK for loading p2p content

`npm install --save hypercore-fetch`

```javascript
import makeHyperFetch from 'hypercore-fetch'
import * as SDK from 'hyper-sdk'

// Create in-memory hyper-sdk instance
const sdk = await SDK.create({storage: false})

const fetch = await makeFetch({
  sdk: true,
  writable: true
})

const someURL = `hyper://TODO_REAL_URL_HERE_PLEASE`

const response = await fetch(someURL)

const data = await response.text()

console.log(data)
```

## API

### `makeHyperFetch({sdk, writable=false, extensionMessages = writable, renderIndex}) => fetch()`

Creates a hypercore-fetch instance.

The `sdk` argument should be an instance of [hyper-sdk](https://github.com/RangerMauve/hyper-sdk).

The `writable` flag toggles whether the `PUT`/`POST`/`DELETE` methods are available.

`extensionMessages` enables/disables Hypercore Extension Message support which is used for sending extra data to peers on top of hypercore replication streams.

`renderIndex` is an optional function to override the HTML index rendering functionality. By default it will make a simple page which renders links to files and folders within the directory.
This function takes the `url`, `files` array and `fetch` instance as arguments.

After you've created it, `fetch` will behave like it does in [browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

### Common Headers

Each response will contain a header for the canonical URL represented as a `Link` header with `rel=canonical`.

There is also an `ETag` header which will be a JSON string containging the drive's current `version`, or the file's sequence number.
This will change only when the drive has gotten an update of some sort and is monotonically incrementing.
The `ETag` representing a file's sequence number represents the version the Hyperdrive was at when the file was added.
Thus you can get the previous version of a file by using `hyper://NAME/$/version/${ETAG}/example.txt`.

If the resource is a file, it may contain the `Last-Modified` header if the file has had a `metadata.mtime` flag set upon update.

### `fetch('hyper://NAME/example.txt', {method: 'GET'})`

This will attempt to load `example.txt` from the archive labeled by `NAME`.

It will also load `index.html` files automatically for a folder.
You can find the details about how resolution works in the [resolve-dat-path](https://github.com/RangerMauve/resolve-dat-path/blob/master/index.js#L3) module.

`NAME` can either be the 52 character [z32 encoded](https://github.com/mafintosh/z32) key for a Hyperdrive or Hypercore , or a domain to parse with the [DNSLink](https://www.dnslink.io/) standard.

### `fetch('hyper://NAME/example/', {method: 'GET'})`

When doing a `GET` on a directory, you will get a directory listing.

By default it will return a JSON array of files and folders in that directory.

You can differentiate a folder from files by the fact that it ends with a `/`.

You can set the `Accept` header to `text/html` in order to have it return a basic HTML page with links to files and folders in that directory.
This can be overrided with the `renderIndex` option if you want custom index pages.

e.g.

```json
["example.txt", "posts/", "example2.md"]
```

Files in the directory will be listed under their name, sub-directories will have a `/` appended to them.

`NAME` can either be the 52 character [z32 encoded](https://github.com/mafintosh/z32) key for a Hyperdrive or Hypercore , or a domain to parse with the [DNSLink](https://www.dnslink.io/) standard.

### `fetch('hyper://NAME/example/?noResolve', {method: 'GET'})`

Adding `?noResolve` to a URL will prevent resolving `index.html` files and will attempt to load the path as is.
This can be useful for list files in a directory that would normally render as a page.

`NAME` can either be the 52 character [z32 encoded](https://github.com/mafintosh/z32) key for a Hyperdrive or Hypercore , or a domain to parse with the [DNSLink](https://www.dnslink.io/) standard.

### `fetch('hyper://localhost/?key=NAME', {method: 'POST'})`

In order to create a writable Hyperdrive with its own URL, you must first generate a keypair for it.

`NAME` can be any alphanumeric string which can be used for key generation in [Corestore](https://github.com/holepunchto/corestore).

The response body will contain a `hyper://` URL with the new Hyperdrive.

You can then use this with `PUT`/`DELETE` requests.

Note that this is only available with the `writable: true` flag.

### `fetch('hyper://localhost/?key=NAME', {method: 'GET'})`

If you want to resolve the public key URL of a previously created Hyperdrive, you can do this with the `GET` method on the key creation URL.

`NAME` can be any alphanumeric string which can be used for key generation in [Corestore](https://github.com/holepunchto/corestore).

The response body will contain a `hyper://` URL with the new Hyperdrive.

You can then use this with `PUT`/`DELETE` requests.

Note that this is only available with the `writable: true` flag.

### `fetch('hyper://NAME/example.txt', {method: 'PUT', body: 'Hello World'})`

You can add files to archives using a `PUT` method along with a `body`.

The `body` can be any of the options supported by the Fetch API such as a `String`, `Blob`, `FormData`, or `ReadableStream`.

`NAME` can either be the 52 character [z32 encoded](https://github.com/mafintosh/z32) key for a Hyperdrive or Hypercore , or a domain to parse with the [DNSLink](https://www.dnslink.io/) standard.

Note that this is only available with the `writable: true` flag.

An attempt to `PUT` a file to a hyperdrive which is not writable will
fail with status `403`.

### `fetch('hyper://NAME/folder/', {method: 'PUT', body: new FormData()})`

You can add multiple files to a folder using the `PUT` method with a [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) body.

You can [append](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) to a FormData with `formData.append('file', content, 'filename.txt')` where `fieldname` gets ignored (use something like `file`?) the `content` can either be a String, Blob, or some sort of stream.
The `filename` will be the filename within the directory that gets created.

Note that you must use the name `file` for uploaded files.

`NAME` can either be the 52 character [z32 encoded](https://github.com/mafintosh/z32) key for a Hyperdrive or Hypercore , or a domain to parse with the [DNSLink](https://www.dnslink.io/) standard.

### `fetch('hyper://NAME/example.txt', {method: 'DELETE'})`

You can delete a file or directory tree in a Hyperdrive by using the `DELETE` method.

`NAME` can either be the 52 character [z32 encoded](https://github.com/mafintosh/z32) key for a Hyperdrive or Hypercore , or a domain to parse with the [DNSLink](https://www.dnslink.io/) standard.

Note that this is only available with the `writable: true` flag.

An attempt to `DELETE` a file in a hyperdrive which is not writable
will fail with status `403`.

### `fetch('hyper://NAME/$/extensions/')`

You can list the current [hypercore extensions](https://github.com/hypercore-protocol/hypercore#ext--feedregisterextensionname-handlers) that are enabled by doing a `GET` on the `/$/extensions/` directory.

This will give you a directory listing with the names of all the extensions.

Note that this requires the `extensionMessages: true` flag.

### `fetch('hyper://NAME/$/extensions/EXTENSION_NAME')`

You can list the peers that you are replication with which have registered this extension by doing a `GET` to the directory for the extension.

This is also how you can register an extension that hasn't been registered yet.

The list will be a JSON array with objects that contain the fields `remotePublicKey` and `remoteHost`.

Note that this requires the `extensionMessages: true` flag.

### `fetch('hyper://NAME/$/extensions/', {headers: {'Accept': 'text/event-stream'}})`

Using the `text/event-stream` content type in the `Accept` header will get back an event stream with the extension events.

You can get the browser's [EventSource API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) over hypercore-fetch by using the [@rangermauve/fetch-to-eventsource](https://github.com/RangerMauve/fetch-event-source) module.

The `event` will be the name of the extension you got the data for, the `id` (accessible by `e.lastEventId` in EventSource) will be set to the ID of the peer that sent it.

Only extension messages that have been queried before via a `GET` to the EXTENSION_NAME will be visible in this stream.

There are also two special events: `peer-open` which gets emitted whena new peer has connected, and `peer-remove` which gets emitted when an existing peer disconnects.

Note that this requires the `extensionMessages: true` flag.

### `fetch('hyper://NAME/$/extensions/EXTENSION_NAME', {method: 'POST', body: 'Example'})`

You can broadcast an extension message to all peers that are replicating that extension type with a `POST` to the extension's URL.

The `body` of the request will be used as the payload.
Please note that only utf8 encoded text is currently supported due to limitations of the event-stream encoding.

Note that this requires the `extensionMessages: true` flag.

### `fetch('hyper://NAME/$/extensions/EXTENSION_NAME/REMOTE_PUBLIC_KEY', {method: 'POST', body: 'Example'})`

You can send an extension message to a specific peer by doing a `POST` to the extension with their remote public key ID.

The `body` of the request will be used as the payload.
Please note that only utf8 encoded text is currently supported due to limitations of the event-stream encoding.

Note that this requires the `extensionMessages: true` flag.

### `fetch('hyper://NAME/$/version/VERSION_NUMBER/example.txt')`

You can get older views of data in an archive by using the special `/$/version` folder with a version number to view older states.

`VERSION_NUMBER` should be a number representing the version to check out based on the `ETag` of the root of the archive.

From there, you can use `GET` and `HEAD` requests with allt he same headers and querystring paramters as non-versioned paths to data.

Note that you cannot `PUT` or `DELETE` data in a versioned folder.


## Limitations:

- Since we make use of the special directory `$`, you cannot store files in this folder. If this is a major blocker, feel free to open an issue with alternative folder names we should consider.
